# Suicides in India (2001â€“2012)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
**Detailed Analysis of Suicides in India (2001-2012)**

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project analyzes suicide trends in India from 2001 to 2012, exploring key factors such as age, gender, profession, and causes of suicides. Through detailed data visualizations and predictive modeling, the study aims to uncover patterns and provide insights for awareness and intervention.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview
- **Time Period:** 2001â€“2012
- **Granularity:** Yearly data across Indian states and Union Territories
- **Parameters Analyzed:**
  - Causes of suicides
  - Education status
  - Means adopted
  - Professional profiles
  - Social and age demographics

## Objectives
- Identify trends and patterns in suicide cases based on age, gender, and other parameters.
- Understand regional disparities in suicide causes and methods.
- Predict future suicide trends using machine learning models.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations.
  - `scikit-learn` for predictive modeling.

## ðŸš€ How to Install and Run the Project
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Suicides_In_India.ipynb`) to explore the analysis and visualizations.

## Steps and Methods
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed inconsistencies (e.g., irrelevant age groups like "0-100+").
- Mapped age groups into broader categories (Child, Teen, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior).
- Structured the dataset for effective analysis.

### Key Analyses
- **Age-Based Trends:** Teenagers (35.4%) and Adults (33.9%) exhibited the highest suicide rates.
- **Gender Insights:** Males were significantly more affected, though Teen and Adult females contributed notably.
- **Causes:** Family issues, illnesses, and marital problems emerged as the top contributing factors.
- **Professional Profiles:** Farmers, daily wage earners, and housewives were the most vulnerable.
- **Means Adopted:** Hanging, poisoning, and drowning were the most common suicide methods.
- **Regional Trends:** Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh reported the highest suicide rates.

### Predictive Modeling
- A **Linear Regression** model was developed to forecast suicide rates for the next five years.
- Results showed an **upward trend**, emphasizing the need for interventions and policy action.

## Data Visualizations
- **Age and Gender Distributions:** Pie and bar charts.
- **Yearly Trends:** Line plots showing changes in suicide cases over time.
- **Regional Disparities:** State-wise breakdowns of suicides by causes, means adopted, and professional profiles.
- **Top Causes & Professions:** Bar charts highlighting major insights.
